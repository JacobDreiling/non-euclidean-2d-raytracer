# non-euclidean-2d-raytracer
Prototype for a fascinating VR tool

This can render the visuals for a flatlander living in any (3d-embeddable) surface you can describe with an equation. It's mostly just a proof of concept and could certainly be optimized. In particular, there may be a way to eliminate a function with a bunch of complicated math, probably using some fancy linear algebra, quaternions, bivectors, or something. This program could be extended to render 3d spaces bent in even higher dimensions. I feel like this could be applied to VR to experience all kinds of alternative geometries. How awesome would that be?

The example media shows renderings from:
- A plane with a dip which is dragged infinitely down
- A torus
- A "wormhole" to a parallel plane
